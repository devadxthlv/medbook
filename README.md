## 📌 Executive Overview

**MedBook** is a comprehensive, production-grade healthcare appointment booking system. Built with Django and deployed via a robust DevSecOps pipeline on AWS EC2, it demonstrates advanced architectural patterns, strict security hardening, and continuous delivery mechanisms.

The primary goal of this repository is to showcase a **complete transition from a standard application to a hardened production service**, emphasizing Infrastructure as Code (IaC), zero-downtime deployments, and comprehensive monitoring.

**Production Endpoints:**
* **Primary URL:** [https://3-27-246-227.nip.io](https://3-27-246-227.nip.io)
* **Alias Domain:** [https://medbook.3-27-246-227.nip.io](https://medbook.3-27-246-227.nip.io)

## 🛠 Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | Django 4.2 (Python 3.11) | Rapid development, robust ORM, and built-in security features against CSRF/SQLi. |
| **Database** | MySQL 8.0 | Reliable ACID-compliant data storage, tuned for micro-instance memory constraints. |
| **App Server** | Gunicorn (WSGI) | Production-grade Python server handling concurrent requests efficiently. |
| **Reverse Proxy** | Nginx | Terminates SSL, serves static/media assets directly, and protects Gunicorn via rate limiting. |
| **Containerization** | Docker Compose | Ensures parity between local dev, CI pipeline, and production infrastructure. |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | Integrated testing, Python `safety` scanning, and automated EC2 SSH deployments. |
| **Host Infra** | AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 22.04) | Cost-effective compute environment for monolithic deployments. |

---

## 🏗 Production Architecture

The application is deployed as a tightly integrated, containerized stack. Nginx acts as the gatekeeper, completely isolating the Django/Gunicorn application and the MySQL database from direct internet exposure.

### Request Lifecycle
1. **Client** connects via `https://3-27-246-227.nip.io`.
2. **UFW** permits port 443; **Fail2Ban** monitors for abuse.
3. **Nginx** validates the SSL certificate, enforces security headers, and applies rate limiting (`10r/s`).
4. Static/Media requests are intercepted and served directly by Nginx from shared Docker volumes.
5. Dynamic requests are reverse-proxied over the internal Docker network to **Gunicorn**.
6. **Django** processes the request, interacting with the **MySQL** container internally.

---

## 🛡 Security Architecture

Security is built into the architecture across multiple layers:

### 1. Network & Proxy Security
* **HSTS Enforced:** `Strict-Transport-Security` enforces HTTPS for 1 year, preventing downgrade attacks.
* **Nginx Rate Limiting:** Mitigates application-layer DDoS and credential stuffing.
* **Security Headers:** Enforces CSP, X-Frame-Options (DENY), and X-Content-Type-Options to prevent XSS and clickjacking.

### 2. Host Hardening (`scripts/harden_server.sh`)
* **UFW:** Drops all traffic except ports 22, 80, and 443.
* **SSH Hardening:** Disables password authentication, disables root login, and limits auth retries.
* **Fail2Ban:** Automatically bans IPs exhibiting malicious SSH behavior.

### 3. Application Security (Django)
* **Secure Cookies:** `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` strictly enforced.
* **Dependency Scanning:** The CI pipeline runs `safety` to block deployments containing known Python CVEs.

---

## 🚀 DevSecOps Pipeline

The deployment process is entirely automated to ensure zero-downtime and consistent state.

1. **Push to `main`** triggers GitHub Actions.
2. **CI Tests:** Spins up an ephemeral MySQL container, runs the Django test suite, and scans dependencies.
3. **CD Deployment:**
   * SSH access into the EC2 instance.
   * `git pull` latest changes.
   * `docker compose build` to construct new images.
   * `docker compose up -d` for graceful service restarts.
   * Runs database migrations and static file collection.
4. **Smoke Test:** Executes `scripts/smoke_test.sh` to empirically verify HTTPS reachability and HTTP redirection.

## 💻 Deployment Guide

### Local Development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/devadxthlv/medbook.git
cd medbook
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
cp .env.example .env  # Configure secrets
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

### Production Provisioning (EC2)
1. Clone the repository to the host server.
2. Run server hardening and monitoring scripts:
   ```bash
   sudo bash scripts/harden_server.sh
   sudo bash scripts/setup_cloudwatch.sh
   ```
3. Initialize Let's Encrypt certificates (generates dummies, boots Nginx, provisions real certs):
   ```bash
   bash scripts/init-letsencrypt.sh
   ```
4. Deploy the stack:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/deploy.sh
   ```

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

MedBook utilizes **AWS CloudWatch** for deep system observability (`scripts/setup_cloudwatch.sh`):

* **Resource Metrics:** EC2 Memory and Disk usage are polled every 60 seconds.
* **Security Auditing:** `/var/log/auth.log` is streamed in real-time to CloudWatch Logs, allowing centralized tracking of SSH attempts and Fail2Ban actions.
* **Docker Logs:** Standard container logs are managed via Docker's JSON-file driver for localized debugging (`docker compose logs -f`).

---

## 💾 Backup & Recovery

A dedicated backup script (`scripts/backup.sh`) ensures data safety:

1. Connects to the isolated MySQL container.
2. Executes an authenticated `mysqldump`.
3. Compresses the output via `gzip`.
4. Streams the database archive and all user-uploaded media files directly to **Amazon S3**.

*Configured to run automatically via nightly Cron jobs.*

---

## ⚡ Performance & Scalability Notes

* **Memory Tuning:** Due to `t3.micro` constraints (1GB RAM), MySQL is strictly tuned (`innodb-buffer-pool-size=64M`, `performance-schema=OFF`) to prevent Out-Of-Memory (OOM) killer terminations.
* **Worker Allocation:** Gunicorn runs with a conservative worker count to ensure stable memory consumption.
* **Asset Offloading:** Nginx serving static assets eliminates the overhead of passing media requests through the Python application layer.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Single Point of Failure:** The current monolithic EC2 architecture lacks Multi-AZ redundancy.
2. **Local Media Storage:** Currently relies on Docker volumes synced to S3. True distributed scaling requires `django-storages` pointing directly to S3.
3. **Database Coupling:** MySQL shares compute/memory resources with the web application.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

To transition to a true enterprise-scale architecture, the following upgrades are planned:

1. **AWS ECS / Fargate:** Migrate from EC2 Docker-Compose to managed container orchestration for auto-scaling capabilities.
2. **Amazon RDS:** Decouple the MySQL database into a managed, Multi-AZ relational database service.
3. **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Move TLS termination to AWS ACM on an ALB to support horizontal scaling of web workers.
4. **Redis & Celery:** Implement asynchronous task queues for email notifications and background processing.
